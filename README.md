#Think.Plan.Live

This is our website for the final week competition.

The aim of this website is to provide a starting palce and tools for people, especially people in their twenties, to plan their future. 

The idea is quite simple. When one has a whole chunk of time (say after graduation), one may be lost and confused, not knowing how to make the most of the time. Things is always clearer when planning backwards. Setting a goal in the future first, people can easily work out what need to be done by when, so no time will be wasted.
